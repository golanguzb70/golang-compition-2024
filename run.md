# Required Tools
Your project should use the following technologies:
- **Golang** for backend development.
- **PostgreSQL** or **MongoDB** for database management.
- **REST API** for communication between services.
- **Swagger** for API documentation.

# Project Run Instructions
To ensure your project can be evaluated, you must provide a clear way to run the project. The following commands are required:

- **Database Setup:**  
  To start your database, run the following command:
  ```bash
  make run_db
  ```

- **Run the Project:**  
  To start your application, run:
  ```bash
  make run
  ```

Make sure both commands work as expected. Projects that don't follow this setup will not be evaluated.
